ReBirth 338 v2.01 .iso is required at start,
works ok with [MagicISO](https://web.archive.org/web/20210516111743/http://www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-magicdisc-overview.htm?=mdisc_hlp106) Virtual CD/DVD.
MagicISO drivers require Reboot Windows in SafeMode and dissable 7 Driver Enforcement, and install as Administrator. </br>

ReBirth for PC was Discontinued as Freeware in [2005](https://web.archive.org/web/20051130043931/http://www.rebirthmuseum.com/) and replaced by ReBirth for iPad  and Discontinued in [2017](https://help.reasonstudios.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002216853-ReBirth-for-iPad-has-been-discontinued)</br>
ReBirth ReWire worked with [Reason 10](https://reverb.com/news/how-to-combine-2-daws-with-rewire) or older </br>
but requires a large Buffer size </br>
ReWire is similar to [Roland TR-09](https://www.roland.com/us/products/tr-09/) / [TR-08](https://www.roland.com/us/products/tr-08/) USB multi-channel audio driver. </br>

ReBirth works in Linux, but there is No ProTools for Linux, and there is No Wine/ReWire to Jack Audio, like WineAsio. </br>

PSP Audioware MasterQ 1.0.2 - 1.5.2 works with [DDMF metaplugin](https://ddmf.eu/metaplugin-chainer-vst-au-rtas-aax-wrapper/) in AAX </br>
1.0.2 does Not have latency when FAT Mode is OFF, later versions have Fixed Latency. </br>
MasterQ 1 was Discontinued and replaced with MasterQ2, but still for sale if you ask support. </br>
MasterQ2 has different algorithms according to .pdf manual, i prefer v1.0.2 </br>
has medium size Q curve vs. Waves REQ "Narrow Q" or McDSP Channel G </br>
there is 4 or 5 Q curve types that most Hardware EQ´s follow from Wide to Narrow,  </br>
Symmetric Boost & Cut or Asymetric like Waves REQ. </br>
Avid d2/d3 also very nice for DSP. </br>
