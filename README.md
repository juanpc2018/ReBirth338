﻿in Windows 8.1x64 + [WinHelp](﻿https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/error-opening-help-in-windows-based-programs-feature-not-included-or-help-not-supported-3c841463-d67c-6062-0ee7-1a149da3973b) [x86](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=47667) / [x64](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=47671)

ReBirth 338 v2.01 .iso is required at start, works with [MagicISO](https://web.archive.org/web/20210516111743/http://www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-magicdisc-overview.htm?=mdisc_hlp106) Virtual CD/DVD.</br>
MagicISO CD/DVD drivers require to Reboot Windows in SafeMode to Dissable 7 Driver Enforcement, then install as Administrator and/or allow Windows to load testsigned drivers with cmd "bcdedit /set testsigning on" </br>
 
ReBirth for PC was Discontinued & Released as Freeware in [2005](https://web.archive.org/web/20051130043931/http://www.rebirthmuseum.com/) replaced by ReBirth for iPad, Discontinued in [2017](https://help.reasonstudios.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002216853-ReBirth-for-iPad-has-been-discontinued)</br>
ReWire worked with [Reason 10](https://reverb.com/news/how-to-combine-2-daws-with-rewire) or older </br>
There is no ReWire support in [Cubase 12](https://forums.steinberg.net/t/i-didnt-see-where-is-rewire-menu/914704) onwards. </br>

ReBirth requires to open the software, test a Benchmark: 22900 here i3-12100 with Balanced power settings, then opens a help file, select drivers/settings & close Rebirth. </br>
ReBirth cannot be opened in ReWire mode when running ReBirth for the 1st time. </br>
ReWire requires a large Buffer size in ProTools or audio will have glitches; </br>
Open ProTools, create a session, 48KHz, Open ReBirth, ReWire drivers are auto-detected by ProTools as mono channel instrument. </br>
ReWire is similar to Roland [TR-09](https://www.roland.com/us/products/tr-09/) / [TR-08](https://www.roland.com/us/products/tr-08/) USB multi-channel audio driver. </br>
Roland also sells a more advanced modern software version of the [909](https://www.roland.com/us/products/rc_tr-909/), [808](https://www.roland.com/us/products/rc_tr-808/), [606](https://www.roland.com/us/products/rc_tr-606/).

ReBirth works in [Linux](https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=846551) but there is No ProTools for Linux, and there is No Wine/ReWire to Jack Audio, like WineAsio. </br>
Having multi-channel output for mixing audio on a DAW is the goal of ReWire. </br>

[ReMaker v1.32](https://nordbeat.com/en/download-center/) converts Rebirth songs to MIDI </br>

[PSP Audioware MasterQ](https://web.archive.org/web/20110207212139/http://pspaudioware.com/plugins/equalizers/psp_masterq/) 1.0.2 - 1.5.2 VST works with [DDMF metaplugin](https://ddmf.eu/metaplugin-chainer-vst-au-rtas-aax-wrapper/) in AAX </br>
DX version works with [VB-Audio FFX4](http://vincent.burel.free.fr/download/index.htm) sounds a bit more transparent vs. VST </br>
v1.0.2 does Not have latency when FAT Mode is OFF, later versions have Fixed Latency. </br>
v1.5.2 does Not have DX version, but has RTAS version. </br>
[MasterQ1](https://web.archive.org/web/20110207212139/http://pspaudioware.com/plugins/equalizers/psp_masterq/) was Discontinued and replaced with [MasterQ2](https://www.pspaudioware.com/products/psp-masterq2), MQ1 still for sale if ask support. </br>
[MasterQ2](https://www.pspaudioware.com/products/psp-masterq2) has a bit different algorithms "80-bit ﬂoating point", i prefer v1.0.2 "64-Bit DP FP" </br>
has medium size Q curves vs. Waves REQ "Narrow Q" or McDSP Channel G </br>
there is 4 or 5 Q curve types that most Hardware EQ´s follow from Wide to Narrow,  </br>
Symmetric Boost & Cut or Asymetric Boost & Cut like Waves REQ, or Constant Q Boost & Cut. </br>
Avid d2/d3 very nice for DSP. </br>
